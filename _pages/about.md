I'm a BME Ph.D. candidate based at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD who enjoys building tools that enable data-driven neuroscience.

I have a wide array of experience, from using electrochemistry to understand neural systems at the [Sombers Lab](https://www.somberslab.org/) in my undergrad at [NC State](https://www.bme.ncsu.edu/) and to building tools that enable terascale neuroscience at [NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/) at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/). These opportunities allowed me the pleasure to work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

When I'm not doing work, I like to read books and go on hikes!
